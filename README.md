# api-classroom-version2
This repository is version 2 of my project in Advanced Web Development course. You can see it [here](https://github.com/hoangthe2924/classroom-api). In this version, we add Assignment Tab and allow student upload their assignments to host's drive.

## Tutorial:

### TO INSTALL THE DEPENDENCIES OF THE APP: `npm install`

You need this command to install all required dependencies.

### TO START THE APP: `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### IN THE DEVELOPMENT MODE: `npm run dev`

It works the same as `npm start`, but whenever you save your code, the project is automately rebuild thanks to Nodemon library.
